### INSIGHTS

1.) Sales Trends & Seasonality
- Peak Sales Months: July recorded the highest sales (~$96M), followed by August, indicating a seasonal sales trend. This could be due to back-to-school promotions or summer sales events.
-	Lowest Sales Month: April had the lowest sales (~$57M), which might suggest a post-holiday slump or reduced demand. Targeted marketing campaigns could help boost sales inÂ weakerÂ months

2.) Product Category Insights
- Best-Selling Product: Menâ€™s Apparel ($209M) and Menâ€™s Athletic Footwear ($179M) were the top revenue-generating categories, showing strong demand.
- Opportunities for Growth: Other product categories, such as womenâ€™s footwear and apparel, have lower sales and may require better positioning, targeted advertising, or bundling strategies.

3.) Regional Performance
- Top-Performing Region: The West region contributed the highest profit ($90M), followed by the Northeast ($68M). These regions should be prioritized for expansion and promotional activities.
- Underperforming Regions: The South and Southeast regions had lower sales and profit margins, indicating potential areas for strategic improvements, such as localized marketing or better distributionÂ channels.

4.)  Retailer Performance
- Top Retailers:
		West Group ($243M sales, $86M profit) and Foot Locker ($220M sales, $81M profit) contributed significantly to total sales and profits.
		Sports retailers ($182M sales, $74M profit) also performed well, reinforcing the importance of specialized retail channels.
- Low-Performing Retailers:
		Walmart ($75M sales, $29M profit) and Amazon ($78M sales, $29M profit) showed lower profitability despite decent revenue. 
    This suggests potential margin issues, requiring pricing strategyÂ adjustments.
  
  ### RECOMMENDATIONS
  
- Capitalize on peak sales months: Enhance promotional campaigns during July and August to maximize revenue.
- Improve regional strategies: Focus on boosting sales in underperforming regions (South & Southeast) with localized marketing efforts.
- Optimize product portfolio: Expand successful categories like menâ€™s apparel and athletic footwear while improving visibility for lower-selling categories.
- Refine retailer partnerships: Strengthen relationships with high-performing retailers while reassessing pricing/margins for lower-profitÂ channels
